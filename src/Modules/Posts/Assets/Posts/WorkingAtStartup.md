# Software Life at startup

## Introduction

Winter 2024 in Singapore, it is called winter but actually it is not winter. I damn hot sia. But still a fun and warm winter as I got friends and talent collages beside me. I was in a serial A startup [Privyr](https://www.privyr.com/), it is such a nice place with amazing people. I never saw a company with such-western culture in Singapore. Bravo my mentors Pranav Gore, Putu Yoga.

## Startup culture

Startup is where idea come and go at fast pace. The idea can change really fast, require you to adapt really fast. You must be fast and have a strong stand point. 


## Keypoint

### Being proactive

Always be proactive in clearing ambious in requirement. What is implemented can be totally different from the initial requirements. So I should bne clear what is the goal, before start to write the first line of code, it could save you a lot of time 

### Balance work-life

Working in a startup, where a release cycle of a big feature can be one-two weeks to meet the deadline of user, you should prepare for extensive week. So please please prepare for it, and give you some pace to balance life. That will not about your life, but also your quality of work. Being in a good mood, 8-hours-sleep will allow to write the best line of code.  

### Priority

As a new joiner, it is very hard to know what bring the most impact to your team. But believe me, from the time you know what is important to company, you will make the most impactful contribution. 


### Responsibilty

Not too aggressive in ownership of your code, but you still need to take ownership of your code, I mean you need to take responsiblity of the quality of the code you write, ensure it is easy for other developer to understand, maintainable, scable. Because in startup, it is the start of thing, what you built is the core of a system, your code will make a lot impact if company grow in size, a lot of new generation of developer will look at your code.
